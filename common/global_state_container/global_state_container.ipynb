    "\n",
    "Note that, in a sense, the global state is part of the physical layer [ELABORATE].\n",

    "The state is initialized in the $|\\underbrace{000\\ldots}_{\\text{n times}}\\rangle$ state. Note that it's a pure state.\n",

    "We use QuTip for simulation of quantum operations on the global quantum state of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't have to worry about race conditions right away because operations done on the global state are currently coming from different qubits, and the so the gates commute; i.e., it doesn't matter when qubit changes the state first -- as long as all the gates are executed the state should be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use persistent photons: the photons we use to send stuff through optical fibers are properties of the opticalFiber object, and have corresponding qubits in the global state. We have two photons per optical fiber: a photon going to the right and a photon going to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use that following convention for the order of the qubits in the global state: \n",

    "Note that you can use any convention you want as long as you make consistent use of the qubit ids."

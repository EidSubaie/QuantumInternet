### Guidelines

##### 1- Questions. 

  * a) If you have a question, you may ask it in the form of an issue. To raise an issue, simply go to the issues tab and create a new issue. Try to create an issue only when necessary (see point 3 below!). 

##### 2- Be helpful!

##### 3- Help us avoid a mess. 

Open source projects with collaboration on the wide-scale we are going for here can become very messy. Surprisingly, they often don't! Good guidlines help maintain order. The following are a few such guidelines:

* a) Be polite and thoughtful of others. Let you aim be to understand the other's person point of view, then to learn from them if they are right, and to teach them if they are wrong.

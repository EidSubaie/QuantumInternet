    "Physically, a photon passing through an optical fiber can be modelled by a quantum channel acting on the state of the qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optical fiber is used in this scenario: repeater 1 wants to share entanglement with repeater 2. So repeater 1 prepares an EPR pair locally, then sends one half of the pair to repeater 2 through the quantum channel that models the passage of a photon through the fiber. The channel is applied to the qubit (in the global state container) in the function `carryQubit` below. For now we model the photon transmission by an identity map for simplicity until the simualtor is built up a bit."

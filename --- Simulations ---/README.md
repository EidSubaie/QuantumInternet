Here we write the simulations we need to test the protocols we develop in the repository.

In our tests we look for the following things: 
- The performance of the protocols in terms of entanglement rate.
- The sensitivity of the protocol performances to changes in the simulation models of the hardware; for example, what happens if we do not assume that all the qubits in a quantum repeater have identical coherence times.

## Abstract
This document specifies a definition and pseudo-code for the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol known as BB84 [[1]](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82447194.pdf).

## Introduction
The BB84 protocol enables two distant parties, (historically known as Alice and Bob), to share a secret key. Quantum mechanics ensures that this key cannot be read by an eavesdropper (also, historically known as Eve) without causing a traceable disturbance to the communications.

## Protocol Definition
1) Alice and Bob share a quantum channel that can transmit polarized photons between themselves
2) Alice can choose one of four polarizations for each photon. These polarizations are grouped into two sets of orthogonal axes:

    a) Vertical (V)  
    b) Horizontal (H)  
    c) Left (L - this is V rotated -45°)  
    c) Right (R - this is H rotated -45°)

3) Alice transmits her secret key consisting of randomly polarized photons
4) Bob receives Alice's secret key and analyses each photon with a beam-splitter in the axis of his choice (either V/H or L/R)
5) If Bob chooses the correct polarization (i.e. photon N is sent from Alice with V polarization and measured by Bob with the same V axis direction) then he will obtain the correct result. However, if Bob was to choose the wrong measurement axis (i.e. photon N is sent from Alice with V polarization and measured by Bob in the H direction) then the result will be random and meaningless for further communications
6) Bob now reconciles with Alice (via a classical channel) to determine his right choices in measuring N photons in the secret key, thus knowing a percentage of the secret key. These correct axis choices can be determined by sharing orientation choices by Alice to Bob and from Bob to Alice. Common (correct) choices are then used as the secret key for future communication

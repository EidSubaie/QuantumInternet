## Abstract
This document specifies a definition for the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol known as BB84 [[1]](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82447194.pdf).

## Introduction
The BB84 protocol enables two distant parties, (historically known as Alice and Bob), to share a secret key. Quantum mechanics ensures that this key cannot be read by an eavesdropper (also, historically known as Eve) without causing a traceable disturbance to the communications.
